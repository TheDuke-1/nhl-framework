2023-24   FLA     #4          #4          Bobrovsky carried playoffs
2022-23   VGK     #6          #6          Surprise run; Thompson hot
2021-22   COL     #2          #2          Dominant analytically + Kuemper

2019-20   TB      #3          #2          V7.2 +1 (bubble playoffs)
2018-19   STL     #6          #6          Binnington came from nowhere
2017-18   WSH     #7          #7          Ovechkin's run; poor analytically
2016-17   PIT     #3          #4          V7.1 +1 (back-to-back)
2015-16   PIT     #5          #5          Murray rookie heroics
2014-15   CHI     #4          #5          V7.1 +1 (Crawford clutch)

MODEL ASSESSMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Strengths:
  - 70% top-5 accuracy is strong for playoff prediction
  - 100% top-10 accuracy means model never completely misses
  - Average winner rank ~4.4 indicates contender identification works

Weaknesses:
  - Missed VGK 2023 (ranked #6) - hot goalie runs unpredictable
  - Missed WSH 2018 (ranked #7) - captain-driven playoff runs
  - Missed STL 2019 (ranked #6) - midseason turnarounds

DATA LIMITATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Historical data covers only 6-16 teams per season (not full 32)
  - GSAx data quality varies by season (best post-2018)
  - Some seasons missing key teams that didn't make data compilation

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Both formulas perform similarly; V7.1 has slight edge in top-3 accuracy
2. Consider hybrid approach for specific playoff scenarios
3. Model is useful for identifying contenders, not guaranteeing winners
4. Hot goalie runs (Binnington, Thompson) remain unpredictable
5. Playoff experience/intangibles not captured by current metrics

CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The V7.2 formula maintains strong predictive power (70% top-5) while
emphasizing goaltending - a theoretically sound adjustment. However,
historical backtest shows minimal improvement over V7.1.

Current model should be used as a CONTENDER IDENTIFIER, not a winner predictor.
Teams ranked 1-5 by weight have historically produced 70% of Cup winners.
