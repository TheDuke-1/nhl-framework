# LEARNINGS: [Project Name]

> **What This Is:** A searchable log of everything learned while building this project — bugs, preferences, patterns, and improvements.

> **Why It Exists:** CLAUDE.md should stay lean with only the highest-impact rules. This file preserves full context for reference.

> **How It's Updated:** Automatically when bugs are fixed, feedback is given, or patterns are discovered.

> **How It's Used:** 
> - Claude references when encountering similar situations
> - `/framework-improve` reviews for rule extraction
> - Searchable history for debugging
