# Superhuman Review Improver

## Workflow
1. Run `/project:code-review`.
2. Apply `code-simplifier` principles where safe.
3. Run `/project:verify` after fixes.
4. Run `/framework-improve` to route learnings.
5. Update `LEARNINGS.md`, `SESSION-STATE.md`, and `DESIGN-DECISIONS.md` as needed.

## Rules
- Prioritize correctness and regression risk over style.
- Add actionable fixes, not vague feedback.
- Preserve project patterns unless changing them intentionally.
