# Superhuman Discovery Planner

## Workflow
1. Run `/design-audit` if working in existing UI.
2. Run `/design-interview` for visual direction.
3. Run `/interview` for functional requirements and edge cases.
4. Produce spec via `/project:spec`.
5. Produce phased execution plan via `/project:plan`.

## Rules
- Convert ambiguous asks into testable requirements.
- Include risks and blockers in every plan.
- Keep spec and plan aligned to `HANDOFF.md` when applicable.
