I need to plan this feature/change: $ARGUMENTS

## Planning Rules (from Matt Pocock's approach)

Think hard about this. Present a plan that is:
- **Concise**: Max 15-20 lines. Sacrifice grammar for brevity.
- **Scannable**: I should understand it in 30 seconds.
- **Actionable**: Each line describes a specific change, not a vague goal.
- **Ordered**: Steps in the exact sequence you'll implement them.

## Plan Format

**Goal**: [One sentence — what we're building]

**Changes**:
1. [File: what changes]
2. [File: what changes]
3. ...

**Tests**: [What tests to add/modify]

**Risk**: [One line — biggest risk or thing that could go wrong]

**Questions for you**:
1. [Non-obvious question about a decision point]
2. [Edge case or tradeoff you want my input on]

Wait for my approval before writing any code. When I approve, switch to implementation and one-shot the entire plan.
